# Minecraft Data Packs (Java Edition)

Tested on version 1.20.2, but should be compatible with version 1.19.3+.

## Nether travel ratio

Vanilla travel ratio is 1:8, i.e. travelling 1 block in the Nether equals 8 blocks of travel in the Overworld. These data packs changes that ratio to 1:4, 1:2, and equidistant 1:1 ratio.

Why? Because the Nether is finally beautiful and we should spend more time down there!

Most likely incompatible with other data packs that overwrite the same file (the_nether.json).

## Prevent building on Nether roof

Sets the build limit to level 128 where the topmost bedrock roof spawns. This means you cannot build on top of the roof, which also means you can't break the bedrock from above. However, it does not mean you cannot get up there, but once you're there you're gonna be stuck.

Why? Because the roof is ugly, and if you wanna farm in the Nether you should do it below the roof. Also you'll get better spawn rates for your farms the lower you go, at least once you've spawn proofed the surfaces. So get crackin!

Most likely incompatible with other data packs that overwrite the same file (the_nether.json).

## "Nether fixes"

Combination of 1:4 ratio and roof building prevention in the same data pack because they both overwrite the same file and as such (I believe) cannot be used at the same time.
